# Container Images Design

This document describes the design principles behind the S2I OpenStack container
images. For repository structure, build commands, and contributor workflows, see
the [developer guide](developer-guide.md).

The full upstream design document, covering the broader container-images vision
including CI integration, operator workflows, and tested-tag promotion, lives at
[dev-docs/container-images-design.md][upstream-design]. This document focuses on
the Containerfile design principles and build-time concerns specific to this
repository.

## Design Goals

1. **Source-based builds** -- Build OpenStack services directly from upstream git
   repositories rather than pre-built packages. This allows building from any
   combination of branches, tags, or in-review patches for the main service, its
   plugins, and its dependencies.

2. **Kolla-compatible runtime interface** -- The kolla entrypoint,
   configuration, and user management scripts are available in the base image
   but their usage is optional. Services can use them for compatibility with
   existing openstack-k8s-operators deployments or provide their own entrypoint
   and configuration files in the expected locations.

3. **Flat image hierarchy** -- A single `openstack-base` image, with all service
   images built directly on top. No intermediate per-project layers.

4. **Smart consolidation** -- Services sharing the same Python package and
   similar non-Python dependencies share a single image. Services with
   significantly different system dependencies get separate images.

5. **Multi-stage builds** -- Build tools, compilers, and source code are
   confined to the build stage and discarded. The final image contains only
   runtime dependencies.

6. **Reproducibility** -- Every source repo is pinned to a specific commit hash.
   Upper-constraints are pinned to a specific commit. Dependency lockfiles are
   generated with `pip-compile` and committed. Builds from the same inputs
   produce the same dependency set.

7. **CI integration** -- The repository can be easily integrated into CI
   workflows to validate changes both in the openstack-k8s-operators and in
   third-party jobs for upstream OpenStack repositories.

8. **Full source build support** -- Containerfiles accept a `PIP_NO_BINARY`
   build argument so that all Python dependencies can be compiled from source
   rather than installed from pre-built wheels. This is not the default but
   enables use cases that require building every dependency from source (e.g.,
   for license compliance or platform-specific optimizations). Set
   `PIP_NO_BINARY=:all:` at build time to activate this mode.

## Containerfile Principles

### Base image

The `openstack-base` image is a single-stage build on UBI 10 (`ubi-minimal`). It
installs system packages, Python, pip, the kolla helper scripts, and the common
Python dependencies shared across all services. Every service image inherits from
it via `--build-arg BASE_IMAGE`.

### Service images

Service images use a multi-stage build. All compilation, wheel building, and
source handling happen in the build stage. The runtime stage carries only the
pre-built artifacts and runtime dependencies, keeping the final image free of
compilers, headers, and source code.

### Dependency files

Each image declares its binary (system) and Python dependencies in a set of
pre-defined plain-text files, separated by build-time vs. runtime scope. See the
[developer guide](developer-guide.md#dependency-files) for the full list and
format.

### Source overrides

Patched or replaced dependencies can be placed under `src/overrides/<pkg>/`
without any `sources.txt` entry. The filtered constraints file excludes these
packages so the overridden version takes precedence.

### Configuration files

Config files come from three sources: the upstream source tree (copied during the
build stage), generated artifacts (e.g., `oslo-config-generator` output), and
manually maintained files in `config/` directories. Each file is listed
explicitly in the Containerfile with full source and destination paths -- no
directory-level copies -- so the build fails immediately if a file is missing.

Examples of files to include: sudoers rules, rootwrap configs, api-paste.ini,
default service config, policy files, etc.

Examples of files to exclude: systemd units, logrotate configs, sysv init
scripts, tmpfiles.d entries, etc.

## CI, Validation, and Publication

The repository provides tooling to run periodic CI jobs that propose PRs
updating the pinned commit hashes in `sources.txt` to the latest upstream
commits. These PRs trigger builds and validation against the
openstack-k8s-operators environment, so that container images pushed to the
registry have been verified to be functional.

Container images are published by the Zuul post-merge job to
`quay.io/openstack-s2i-containers/` with two tags per image:

- **`<stream>-latest`** -- rolling tag, always pointing to the last successfully
  built and validated containers for that stream.
- **`<stream>-<sha>`** -- immutable tag tied to the specific commit in this
  repository that produced the build. These tags have an automatic expiration
  set via the Quay API.

For example, for the `master` stream an image is tagged as both
`master-latest` and `master-<commit-sha>`.

Every image also carries OCI labels set at build time:

- `org.opencontainers.image.revision` -- the s2i-openstack-containers git
  commit that produced the build (`GIT_REVISION`, Zuul `zuul.newrev`, or GHA
  `github.sha`).
- `s2i.openstack.org/stream` -- the build stream (for example `master`).

The post-merge push writes a digest catalog (`content-set.yaml`) next to the
build logs so consumers can pin by digest instead of racing `:master-latest`.
